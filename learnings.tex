\begin{abstract}
Writing with AI is usually promised as a shortcut; I found it most useful as an obstacle course. Over a 12-hour collaborative session, a human linguist and an AI agent refined a meta-study on grammatical variation. The breakthrough came not from asking the model to generate text, but from forcing it to simulate hostile peer reviewers ("Simulated Advisory Board") and audit its own "hallucinated competences" against a rigorous pedagogical log. By treating the AI as an "epistemic adversary" rather than a copywriter, I engineered a paper that is tighter, funnier, and more honest than either intelligence could have produced alone.
\end{abstract}

\section{The diff as dialogue}
The blank page is no longer the enemy. The enemy is plausible mediocrity. This workflow inverted the standard LLM paradigm: rather than prompting for volume ("write 500 words on X"), I prompted for friction. I treated every \texttt{git diff} not as an update, but as a transcript of a negotiation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Lesson:} Don't use the AI to write the text; use the text to rewrite the AI. The \enquote{Forking Paths} log prevented hidden flexibility by forcing me to document every abandoned alternative.
\end{itemize}

\section{Simulation as critique (getting Zimmered)}
I convened a \enquote{Simulated Advisory Board} featuring the ghosts of scientific rigor past and present: Carl Zimmer (for narrative stakes) and Peter Godfrey-Smith (for epistemic hygiene). When the draft claimed I was measuring \enquote{capacity,} the simulated Zimmer didn't buy it. He demanded to know if I was just measuring \enquote{what gets printed.} This wasn't just a style edit; it was an epistemic rescue mission.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Lesson:} A mirror that always flatters you is useless. A mirror that shows you your fly is open is invaluable. Use the AI to simulate the reader who wants you to fail.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model as Argument}
The pedagogical log records the pivotal moment when I abandoned the standard \texttt{brms} interface. Why? Because it dropped rows with missing outcomes, silently destroying the selection model. I had to write custom Stan code not for "power," but for \emph{identifiability}. This technical decision became the paper's central argument: you cannot model what you cannot see.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Lesson:} The code is not just a tool; it is a philosophical position. If the default tool hides the selection mechanism, build a new tool.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rhetoric is engineering}
I stopped treating style as a coat of paint and started treating it as load-bearing architecture. \term{Chiasmus}, \term{isocolon}, and \term{ring composition} weren't added for decoration; they were used to lock the argument in place. If the sentence structure doesn't balance, the thought probably doesn't either.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Lesson:} You can debug a paragraph's rhythm with the same precision you debug its code. A sentence that falls flat is a logic error.
\end{itemize}

\section{The tyranny of the preamble}
Nothing disciplined the model effectively as the house style. By enforcing Canadian spelling, Oxford \enquote{-ize} suffixes, and semantic markup like \texttt{\textbackslash olang} and \texttt{\textbackslash term}, I broke the LLM's tendency toward \enquote{Corporate American Default.} Constraints are not limits; they are definitions. Without them, the voice is effectively null.     
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Lesson:} Define your constraints or be defined by your training data.
\end{itemize}
