## Overview

This document outlines a Gelman-style Bayesian reanalysis of MacKenzie & Robinson (2025), which catalogued grammatical variables from *Language Variation and Change* and *Journal of Sociolinguistics* through 2023.

## Why Reanalyze?

The original analysis uses simple proportions and contingency table tests (Fisher's exact, chi-squared). This approach:

1. **Treats observations as independent** - ignoring clustering by paper, author, language
2. **Binarizes outcomes** - collapsing "not analyzed / null / found" into binary comparisons
3. **Conflates selection with outcomes** - doesn't model *why* some variables get tested

A multilevel Bayesian approach addresses all three.

## Data Structure

```
426 variable-variety combinations
├── Clustered by paper (~N papers)
├── Clustered by author(s) (~N unique author combinations)
├── Clustered by language (~N languages)
├── Clustered by journal (2 journals)
└── Varying by year (1990s-2023)
```

**First task:** EDA to determine clustering counts.

## Model Architecture

### Model 1: Selection Model

What predicts whether a variable gets tested for social significance?

$$
\text{logit}(P(\text{tested}_i)) = \alpha + \beta_{\text{type}} \cdot \text{variation\_type}_i + u_{\text{paper}[i]} + u_{\text{author}[i]} + u_{\text{language}[i]} + u_{\text{journal}[i]}
$$

Where $u$ terms are varying intercepts drawn from normal distributions.

**Outcome:** Binary (tested vs not tested)

**Predictors:**
- Variation type (realization vs order vs both)
- Journal
- Year (possibly as smooth term)

**Random effects:**
- Paper
- Author
- Language

### Model 2: Outcome Model (conditional on tested)

Given that a variable was tested, what predicts finding social significance?

**Option A: Binary**
$$
\text{logit}(P(\text{found}_i | \text{tested}_i)) = \alpha + \beta X_i + u_{\text{paper}[i]} + \ldots
$$

**Option B: Multinomial** (preferred)

Model the full outcome: not analyzed / null / found

This is a category-specific model where "not analyzed" is absorbed by the selection model, leaving null vs found conditional on testing.

### Model 3: Domain-Specific Models

Separate (or partially pooled) models for:
- Production
- Perception
- Metalinguistic behavior

**Key question:** Is the evidence base structurally skewed toward production?

### Model 4: Joint Selection-Outcome Model

Potentially model selection and outcome jointly to account for correlation between them (Heckman-style selection correction, Bayesian version).

## Implementation

### Software
- `brms` for multilevel models
- `cmdstanr` if custom Stan needed
- `tidybayes` for posterior visualization

### Workflow
1. Data prep and EDA
2. Fit selection model
3. Fit outcome model (conditional)
4. Fit domain-specific models
5. Compare to original findings
6. Sensitivity analysis

## Questions to Answer

1. **How much variation in "found social significance" is attributable to:**
   - Variable type (realization vs order)?
   - Journal (LVC vs JSlx)?
   - Language?
   - Individual paper/author effects?

2. **Is the literature biased toward production studies?**
   - What's the selection rate for production vs perception vs metalinguistic?
   - Conditional on testing, do success rates differ?

3. **Does the original conclusion hold under multilevel analysis?**
   - Original: realization variables more often show social significance than order variables
   - Does this survive controlling for clustering?

## Priors

Use weakly informative priors (regularizing, not subjective):
- Fixed effects: $\beta \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)$ on log-odds scale
- Varying intercept SDs: $\sigma_u \sim \text{Exponential}(1)$

## Diagnostics

- Posterior predictive checks
- LOO-CV for model comparison
- Trace plots, $\hat{R}$, ESS

## Timeline

Not estimated (per portfolio conventions).
