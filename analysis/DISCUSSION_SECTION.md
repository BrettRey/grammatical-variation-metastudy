## Interpretation: Selection vs Outcome
The core pattern is asymmetric: **selection effects are strong**, while **outcome effects are weak**. Journal, variation type, and time shape whether variables are tested for social significance, but once tested, outcomes show high probabilities and wide uncertainty across groups. This supports a “selection‑driven” explanation for observed differences in the literature: the primary bottleneck is which variables are studied, not whether tested variables can carry social meaning.

## Relation to the Original Claims
MacKenzie & Robinson argue that realization variables show robust evidence of social significance, while order variables suffer from a relative dearth of targeted studies. Our results align with that framing: order variables are much less likely to be tested, and the scarcity of perception/metalinguistic studies in order variables limits conclusions about outcome differences. The modeling does not overturn their qualitative conclusion; instead it formalizes where the evidence gap is located.

## Limitations
- **Sparsity & confounding:** Order variables are rare and heavily concentrated in LVC, which limits journal comparisons.
- **Outcome uncertainty:** The found stage has wide intervals, especially in sparse categories, so weak effects should not be overinterpreted.
- **Coding assumptions:** We follow the authors’ coding schema; NA handling in the dataset is treated as “null” for now, but this remains a documented sensitivity point.
- **Model scope:** We used a joint selection model with random intercepts; more complex structures (random slopes, temporal nonlinearity) were not explored.

## Future Directions
- Expand the corpus beyond two journals to reduce publication‑channel bias.
- Target perception and metalinguistic studies for order variables to reduce outcome uncertainty.
- Explore formal linguistic subtypes beyond realization/order (e.g., multi‑locus variables) and test whether selection biases differ by subtype.
- Consider alternative temporal structures (splines or period effects) if theory suggests non‑linear trends.
