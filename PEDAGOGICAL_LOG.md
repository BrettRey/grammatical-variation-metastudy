# Pedagogical Log

Purpose: capture key modeling decisions, rationales, and lessons learned so the reanalysis is teachable and reproducible.

## Entry Format
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Topic:** short label (e.g., “Selection model vs multinomial”)
- **Decision:** what we chose
- **Rationale:** why we chose it
- **Alternatives:** what we considered and rejected
- **Evidence:** references to notebooks/results
- **Follow-ups:** next checks or sensitivities

## Entries

### 2026-01-10 — Log Initialized
- **Topic:** Project pedagogy
- **Decision:** Start a dedicated pedagogical log alongside `STATUS.md`.
- **Rationale:** Keep teaching-oriented notes separate from project status.
- **Alternatives:** Use only `STATUS.md`.
- **Evidence:** N/A
- **Follow-ups:** Add the first methodological decision once data audit begins.

### 2026-01-10 — Documenting Interaction Norms
- **Topic:** Process transparency
- **Decision:** Update the pedagogical log regularly to capture notable researcher–assistant interactions and teachable moments.
- **Rationale:** Make the workflow legible to newcomers and preserve rationale behind choices.
- **Alternatives:** Keep notes ad hoc in notebooks.
- **Evidence:** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` updates noting log usage.
- **Follow-ups:** Add entries when we resolve model-structure choices or data prep tradeoffs.
